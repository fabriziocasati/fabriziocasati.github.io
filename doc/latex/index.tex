\subsection*{Overview}

{\itshape Clue Solver} is an is intended to be used during a Clue play to help the user play in the best way. More precisely, the user, by means of a G\+UI, is supposed to continously insert into {\itshape Clue Solver} the inquiries that are made during the inquiry phases of a play (i.\+e., insert which cards are searched by another player, which player shows him a card, etc.), so that {\itshape Clue Solver} can use this knowledge to continuously make deductions about the current play (e.\+g.\+: understand which cards are held by a certain adversary player, etc.); the results of these deduction are shown to the user, so that he can use this knowledge to play better during his turns (e.\+g.\+: make better inquiries, decide which room is more convient for him to reach, etc.).

{\itshape Clue Solver} does not allow to directly play Clue with a computer (or any other device)\+: it only provides reasoning support to the user, therefore the players still need the board game to play.

A sketch of the game rules can be found on Wikipedia\+: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo}{\tt https\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Cluedo}. It is assumed that the players use the rules of the classical version of the game, since at the moment {\itshape Clue Solver} does not support game variants.

\subsection*{Reasons for creating {\itshape Clue Solver}}

There are already plenty of programs on the web with the same functionalities of {\itshape Clue Solver} for several devices (computers, tablets and smartphones), and some cases of homonymy may possibly exist. My {\itshape Clue Solver} doesn\textquotesingle{}t have the aim of being an innovative program or a better version of an already esisting one, it is just meant as a free time activity to make some practice with the C++ language, the Qt framework, and so on.

\subsection*{Notes}

The official name of the software is {\itshape Clue Solver}, however, to avoid problems with the space character in the name during computations, the Qt project and the Git\+Hub repository are named {\itshape Clue\+\_\+\+Solver} (i.\+e., an underscore replaces the space).
