<div class="textblock"><h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>Clue Solver</em> is an is intended to be used during a Clue play to help the user play in the best way. More precisely, the user, by means of a GUI, is supposed to continously insert into <em>Clue Solver</em> the inquiries that are made during the inquiry phases of a play (i.e., insert which cards are searched by another player, which player shows him a card, etc.), so that <em>Clue Solver</em> can use this knowledge to continuously make deductions about the current play (e.g.: understand which cards are held by a certain adversary player, etc.); the results of these deduction are shown to the user, so that he can use this knowledge to play better during his turns (e.g.: make better inquiries, decide which room is more convient for him to reach, etc.).</p>
<p><em>Clue Solver</em> does not allow to directly play Clue with a computer (or any other device): it only provides reasoning support to the user, therefore the players still need the board game to play.</p>
<p>A sketch of the game rules can be found on Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo</a>. It is assumed that the players use the rules of the classical version of the game, since at the moment <em>Clue Solver</em> does not support game variants.</p>
<h2>Reasons for creating <em>Clue Solver</em></h2>
<p>There are already plenty of programs on the web with the same functionalities of <em>Clue Solver</em> for several devices (computers, tablets and smartphones), and some cases of homonymy may possibly exist. My <em>Clue Solver</em> doesn't have the aim of being an innovative program or a better version of an already esisting one, it is just meant as a free time activity to make some practice with the C++ language, the Qt framework, and so on.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The official name of the software is <em>Clue Solver</em>, however, to avoid problems with the space character in the name during computations, the Qt project and the GitHub repository are named <em>Clue_Solver</em> (i.e., an underscore replaces the space). </p>
