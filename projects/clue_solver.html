    		<h1>Clue Solver</h1>
            <p>This project started as a desire to learn how to write a program with a graphical user interface (GUI) and from my passion for board games. Since at that time I didn't know anything about object oriented programming (OOP), I used Visual Basic as language, given its simplicity, and Visual Studio as IDE, since it provides a simple way to design GUIs even for non experienced people.</p>
            <p>Some years later, with more knowledge about OOP, I started rewrite this program in C++ to make some practice with this language, since it is the one that later I would have used for my thesis. This version is currently a work in progress.</p>
            <p>The Visual Basic version is not available, but instead tou can find the C++ code on <a href="https://github.com/fabriziocasati/Clue_Solver">this repository</a> on my GitHub account.</p>
