    		<h1>Clue Solver</h1>
            <p>This project started as a desire to learn how to write a program with a graphical user interface (GUI) and from my passion for board games. Since at that time I didn't know anything about object oriented programming (OOP), I used Visual Basic as language, given its simplicity, and Visual Studio as IDE, since it provides a simple way to design GUIs even for non experienced people. <p>Some years later, with more knowledge about OOP, I started rewroting this program in C++ to make some practice with this language, since it is the one that later I would have used for my thesis. This version is currently not completed.</p>
            <p>The program is supposed to help a player during a <a href="">Clue</a> game: in particular, it allows the user to easily keep track of teh current state of the game, and can also apply some simply inference rules to these data to provide new information to the user to improve its changes of victory by discarding all the options that are impossible given the current state of the game.</p>
            <p>The Visual Basic version is not available, but you can find the C++ code on <a href="https://github.com/fabriziocasati/Clue_Solver">this repository</a> on my GitHub account. You can also have a look at the (not yet completed) documentation <a href="https://fabriziocasati.github.io/Clue_Solver/index.html">here</a></p>
