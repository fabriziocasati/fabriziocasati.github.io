    		<h1>Master's Thesis</h1>
            <p>As part of my master's thesis work, I spent almost 8 months (from the second fall of Febraury 2017 till the end of September 2017) at the <a href="https://nes.aau.at/">Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES)</a> in Klagenfurt, Austria, working as a research assistant in field of mobile robots: in particular, the topic of my work is <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1435481/">coordinated multi-robot exploration</a> with energy constraints: the robots have to explore an unknown environment in a cooperative way to efficiently execute this task (e.g.: to reduce the time required to completely explore the unknown environment), but they have a limited battery life and therefore they have to occasionally recharge at some charging locations; however, since these locations are limited in number and they can accomodate only one robot at a time, the robots have to coordinate also their access to them.</p>
            <p>More in details, the first part of my work requires to implement, using <a href="http://www.ros.org/about-ros/">ROS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, some theoretical models already developed by Micha Rappaport and Christian Bettstetter for the scenarios described above. They also collected some data using a Python implementation of these models but instead of using ROS, which is known to be a very realistic framework, they used a simplified one; therefore, the second part of the work is the collection of data using the <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/stage-svn/">Stage simulator</a> and the code written using ROS and then the analisys and comparison of these data with the one originally produced by the two researchers.</p>
            <p>The publicly available version of the code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/aau-ros/aau_multi_robot/tree/energy">this repository</a>, while the remaining part of the work and the most updated and refactored version is on a private repository (since I'm not the only author but instead I extended already existing code, I couldn't make everything publicly available).</p>
