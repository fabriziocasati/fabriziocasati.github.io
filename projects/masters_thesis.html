    		<h1>Master's Thesis</h1>
            <p>As part of my master's thesis work, I spent almost 8 months (from the second fall of Febraury 2017 till the end of September 2017) at the <a href="https://nes.aau.at/">Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES)</a> in Klagenfurt, Austria, working as a research assistant in field of mobile robots: more precisely, the topic of my work is <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1435481/">coordinated multi-robot exploration</a> with energy constraints: the robots have to explore an unknown environment in a cooperative way to efficiently execute this task (e.g.: to reduce the time required to completely explore the unknown environment), but they have a limited battery life and therefore they have to occasionally recharge at some charging locations, but since these locations are limited in number and can accomodate only one robot per time, the robots have to coordinate also their access to them.</p>
            <p>More in details, the first part of my work is to implement in <a href="http://www.ros.org/about-ros/">ROS</a>, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, some theoretical models already developed by Micha Rappaport and Christian Bettstetter for the scenarios described above. They also collected some data using a Python implementation of these models but instead of using ROS, which is known to be a very realistic framework, they used a simplified one; therefore, the second part of the work is the collection of data using <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/stage-svn/">Stage</a> with the code written using ROS and then the analisys and comparison of these data with the one originally produced by the two researchers.</p>
            <p>The publicly available version of the code can be found on the GitHub accout of the institute in <a href="https://github.com/aau-ros/aau_multi_robot/tree/energy">this public repository</a>, while the remaining part (e.g.: the scripts to aggregate the data and the most updated version with some refactoring and improvements) is on a private repository (since I'm not the only author but instead I extended already existing code, there are some copyright issues and I couldn't make everything publicly available).</p>
