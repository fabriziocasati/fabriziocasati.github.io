    		<h1>Master Thesis</h1>
            <p>As part of my Master Thesis work, I spent almost 8 months (from the second fall of Febraury 2017 till the end of September 2017) at the <a href="https://nes.aau.at/">Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES)</a> in Klagenfurt (Austria) working as a research assistant as part of my master's thesis project.</p> 
            <p>The topic of my thesis is <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1435481/">coordinated multi-robot exploration</a> with energy constraints: the robots have to explore an unknown environment in a cooperative way to efficiently execute this task (e.g.: to reduce the time required to complete it), but they have a limited battery life, so, to complete the explorarion, they have to occasionally recharge at some charging locations, but since these locations are limited in number and can accomodate only one robot per time, the robots have to coordinate also their access to them.</p>
            <p>More in details, the first part of my work is to implement in <a href="http://www.ros.org/about-ros/">ROS</a>, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, some theoretical models already developed by Micha Rappaport and Christian Bettstetter for the scenarios described above. They also collected some data using a Python implementation of these models but not using the ROS framework: therefore, the second part of the work is the collection of data using <a href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/stage-svn/">Stage</a> with the code written using ROS and then the analisys and comparison of these data with the one originally produced by the two researchers.</p>
            <p>The publicly available version of the code is on GitHub: you can find it <a href="https://github.com/aau-ros/aau_multi_robot/tree/energy">here</a> (notice that it is not on a "secondary" branch, since it's still a work in progress).</p>
