    		<h1>Master Thesis</h1>
            <p>As part of my Master Thesis work, I spent almost 8 months (from the second fall of Febraury 2017 till the end of September 2017) at the Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems of the Lakeside Labs in Klagenfurt (Austria) working as a research assistant in the mobile robots field: aim of my work was to implement in ROS ... and compare the results obtained by simulations with this code with the data ... As said at the beginning, this activity was part of my final academic project, so I will be able to use the results also to write my Master Thesis.</p> <!--TODO complete-->
