    		<h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Fabrizio Casati, I'm a computer engineer student, currently working on my master thesis while also spending a period abroad in Klagenfurt, Austria (I'm Italian), working as a research assistant at the Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES).</p>
            <p>As a computer engineer, I'm mainly interested in topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as robotics and reinforcement learning: my master thesis covers in fact the implementation in ROS of some theoretical models for the exploration of an unknown environment with a multi-robot system with energy constraints (i.e., the robots have a limited battery life).</p>
            <p>My extracurricular hobbies instead are:
                
 reading, and board game, cards games and video games.
            </p>
