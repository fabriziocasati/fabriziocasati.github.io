    		<h1>About Me</h1>
            <font size="-1">
                <p>My name is Fabrizio Casati, I'm an Italian computer engineer student at the <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/home/">Politecnico di Milano</a> and I've recently finished to spend a period abroad in Klagenfurt (Austria) working as a research assistant at the <a href="https://nes.aau.at/">Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES)</a> as part of my master's thesis project.</p>
                <p>I recently started working as a software engineer at Reply, in the ICT team.</p>
                <p>My main hobbies are:
                    <ul style="margin: -10px" id="hobbies">
                        <li><i>Reading</i>. I particularly like to read crime fiction, fantasy and science fiction books, but also more "challenging" novels (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">Brave New World</a>, one of my favorite) and books related to computer science and engineering. Currently I'm reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians">Percy Jackson & the Olympians</a> series by Rick Riordan and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> by Robert C. Martin.</li>
                        <li><i>Board games</i>. I love games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(game)">Taboo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary">Pictionary</a>, since they allow you to have a lot of fun with friends while at the same time stimulating and challenging you.</li>
                        <li><i>Video games</i>. I like to play video games, particularly in co-op mode, and I also used a game engine, <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">GameMaker: Studio (GMS)</a>, to practice a little bit with video game programming (for instance, I tried to modify and customize <a href="https://hellofangaming.github.io/HelloMarioEngine/">this Mario engine</a> made with GMS).</li>
