    		<h1>About Me</h1>
            <font size="-1">
                <p>My name is Fabrizio Casati, I'm an Italian computer engineer student at the <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/home/">Politecnico di Milano</a> and I'm currently working on my master thesis project while also spending a period abroad in Klagenfurt (Austria) working as a research assistant at the <a href="https://nes.aau.at/">Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES)</a>.</p>
                <p>As a computer engineer, I'm mainly interested in topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as robotics and reinforcement learning: my master thesis covers in fact the implementation in ROS of some theoretical models for the exploration of an unknown environment using a multi-robot system with energy constraints (robots have a limited battery life and have to occasionally recharge).</p>
                <p>My main hobbies are:
                    <ul style="margin: -10px" id="hobbies">
                        <li><i>Reading</i>. I particularly like to read crime fiction, fantasy and science fiction books, but also more "challenging" novels (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">Brave New World</a>, one of my favorite) and books related to computer science and engineering. Currently I'm reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians">Percy Jackson & the Olympians</a> series by Rick Riordan and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> by Robert C. Martin.</li>
                        <li><i>Board games</i>. I love to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(game)">Taboo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary">Pictionary</a>, since they allow you to have a lot of fun with friends while at the same time stimulating and challenging you. I also took part to some "friendly competitions" (e.g.: a "Taboo night" event organized by a local bar).</li>
                        <li><i>Video games</i>. I like to play video games, particularly in co-op mode. Also in this case a took part to some non-professional competitions (sometimes as a team leader), and occasionally I also used a game engine, <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker Studio</a>, to practice a little bit with video game programming (for instance, I tried to modify and customize this <a href="https://hellofangaming.github.io/HelloMarioEngine/">Mario engine</a>).</li>
