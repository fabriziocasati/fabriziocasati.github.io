            <font size="-1">
                <p>My name is Fabrizio Casati, I'm an Italian computer engineer student currently working on his master thesis while also spending a period abroad in Klagenfurt (Austria) working as a research assistant at the Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems (NES).</p>
                <p>As a computer engineer, I'm mainly interested in topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as robotics and reinforcement learning: my master thesis covers in fact the implementation in ROS of some theoretical models for the exploration of an unknown environment using a multi-robot system with energy constraints (i.e., robots have a limited battery life).</p>
                <p>My hobbies are the following:

                        <li>Reading. I like to read crime fiction, fantasy and science fiction books, but also more "challenging" novels (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">Brave New World</a>, one of my favorite) and computer science books. Currently I'm reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians">Percy Jackson & the Olympians</a> series by Rick Riordan and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> by Robert C. Martin.</li>
                        <li>Board game.</li>
